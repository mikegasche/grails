Integrates effortless and appropriate within data-source configuration and helps to create initial data within database through BootStrap.groovy with help of DbUnit. Different DbUnit dataset files (Flat or Strcutured XML) and DbUnit operations (CLEAN_INSERT, UPDATE, etc.) can be specified for different environments (See DataSource.groovy).
Furthermore, the dbunit-operator provides a simple test case 'DbUnitTestCase' (derived from GroovyTestCase) to create jUnit/DbUnit-Tests with seperate test dataset files (See MyTest.groovy).
